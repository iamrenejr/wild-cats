# Cat Gallery

This is a cat gallery built in ReactJS and Typescript. It pulls data from TheCatAPI.

## Points of Interest

* Unit tested (current coverage: 73%)
* Error handling for network errors
* Has loading state (spinner)
* "No data" state when no cat images are found
* Persistent state - lasts through localStorage
* CSS Animations and flexbox layout (for aesthetics)
